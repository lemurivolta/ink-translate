# :pencil2: Ink Translate

This Unity package allows you to handle the translations of a game based on the [ink narrative scripting language](http://www.inklestudios.com/ink) with Unity. It provides tools to extract text, export and import translations in an incremental way. 

The tool is thought to work in an _incremental_ fashion: no translation is ever lost during the process.
