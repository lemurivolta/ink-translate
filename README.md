# :pencil2: Ink Translate

This Unity package allows you to handle the translations of a game based on the ink narrative scripting language with Unity. It provides tools to extract text, export and import translations in an incremental way.

The tool is thought to work in an incremental fashion: no translation is ever lost during the process.

This is the host project, used to develop the package. The package itself is inside [Packages/it.lemurivolta.ink-translate](Packages/it.lemurivolta.ink-translate#readme).
